# About the Project

This project was undertaken with the primary goal of enhancing my skills in Express and Node.js, following the excellent [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9M02of22z4) by Dipesh Malvia. The resulting backend application is capable of managing and storing data in a MongoDB database, while securely responding to user requests.

## Key Features

- **Contact Storage:** The system offers a robust solution for storing user contact information, making it possible to manage and access contacts with ease.

- **Enhanced Security:** To ensure the security of user information, the application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT)-based authentication, as guided in the tutorial.

- **MongoDB Database:** The project integrates with MongoDB, providing a reliable and scalable storage system for user data.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js and Express:** The application is developed in Node.js, with the Express framework to handle routes and controllers, following the tutorial's instructions.

- **MongoDB:** The NoSQL MongoDB database is used to store user contact data, as demonstrated in the tutorial.

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure user authentication, JWT technology is adopted, as explained in the tutorial.

## How to Use

To try out and use this application:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Configure the necessary environment variables, such as database credentials and JWT settings, following the guidelines provided in the tutorial.

3. Run the application using `npm start` or `node server.js`, following the tutorial's instructions.

4. Access the API with the appropriate requests to securely manage your contacts, following the demonstrations provided in the tutorial.
